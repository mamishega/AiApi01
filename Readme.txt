This code uses the OpenAI API to generate code based on a prompt.

First, the code gets the API key from the OpenaiSecrets class and creates an AuthenticationHeaderValue with it. Then, it sets the URL to the OpenAI API endpoint for the Codex model completions.

Next, it sets the prompt for code generation, as well as the temperature and max_tokens values. The data object is then serialized to JSON using JsonConvert.SerializeObject.

A new HttpClient is created with the authorization header set to the AuthenticationHeaderValue created earlier. A POST request is then sent to the OpenAI API with the JSON data.

If the response was successful, the JSON response is parsed and the generated code is printed to the console. Otherwise, an error message with the status code is printed.

The OpenaiSecrets class contains a static method for getting the OpenAI API secrets, which in this case is simply a hardcoded API key.
